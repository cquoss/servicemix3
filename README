Welcome to Apache ServiceMix!
=============================
Apache ServiceMix is an open source distributed Enterprise Service Bus (ESB)
and SOA toolkit built from the ground up on the semantics and APIs of the Java 
Business Integration (JBI) specification JSR 208 and released under the Apache 
2.0 license.

Apache ServiceMix is lightweight and easily embeddable, has integrated Spring 
support and can be run at the edge of the network (inside a client or server),
as a standalone ESB provider or as a service within another ESB. 
You can use ServiceMix in Java SE or a Java EE application server.


Export Notice
============================
This distribution includes cryptographic software.  The country in 
which you currently reside may have restrictions on the import, 
possession, use, and/or re-export to another country, of 
encryption software.  BEFORE using any encryption software, please 
check your country's laws, regulations and policies concerning the
import, possession, or use, and re-export of encryption software, to 
see if this is permitted.  See <http://www.wassenaar.org/> for more
information.

The U.S. Government Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and
Security (BIS), has classified this software as Export Commodity 
Control Number (ECCN) 5D002.C.1, which includes information security
software using or performing cryptographic functions with asymmetric
algorithms.  The form and manner of this Apache Software Foundation
distribution makes it eligible for export under the License Exception
ENC Technology Software Unrestricted (TSU) exception (see the BIS 
Export Administration Regulations, Section 740.13) for both object 
code and source code.
